Adapter pattern :
    This is used to connect new code to legacy code without changing the working contract that was produced in the
    legacy code originally
    create multiple adapter for various object example
    EmployeeCsvAdapter to convert EmployeeCsv to employee

    Contrast
        Adapter
            - works after a code is designed basically legacy code
            - its Retrofitted to make unrelated classes work together
            - it is created to provide a different interface to a legacy code that was intended

        Bridge
            - it is designed upfront to allow Abstraction and Implementation vary
            - built in advance for such cases
            -

        Similarities
            - Both allow multiple system to adapt to them
